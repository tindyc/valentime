# VALENTIME

![Valentime Logo](assets/images/valentime-logo.png)

Created for the Code Institute's February 2022 Hackathon, Love is in the air.

Valentime: Spend more time creating memories!

During lockdown, we had to rethink what a date night was. The local pub was closed, we were unable to eat at our favourite restaurants, and there were no new films showing at the cinemas.

It would have been great to have a site where a suitable at home date night idea could be randomly selected for you ... so we decided to make that idea a reality!

By using the Valentime site to randomly generating a date night idea based on the category you select, you will have more time to spend on the important stuff - making memories with your loved one ❤️.

And as love comes in all different forms, from self love, the love of a friend group to romantic love - we have created seperate sections for each of these - so leave the pain of choosing what to do in the past, and start using Valentime today!

## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the theme of the site is all about love, we chose to use the classic romantic colours of reds and pinks. We have chosen some complementary colours that stand out from the pink to be used throughout the site.

![Valentime Full Site Colour Palette](documentation/colour-palette.webp)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* We are using [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script?query=dancing+script) for the headers on the site.
  ![Dancing Script Font](documentation/dancing-script-font.webp)

* We are using [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=josefin+sans) for the body of the site.

* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. We utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as we went along.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator [FreeFormatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website.

Initially the movies page and food & drink page were showing 2 errors due to a H1 element not having a closing tag. This was added in and the pages then passed.

The contact page initially showed an error shown below, once removed the page passed.

![contact page w3c error](documentation/contact-w3c.png)

All 6 pages have now passed W3C validation checks.

![W3C validator pass](documentation/w3c-pass.png)

The CSS on the site was tested using the [Jigsaw W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) The CSS passed.

### Testing User Stories

* Frequent Visitors

### Lighthouse

We used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Full Testing

To fully test my website we performed the following testing using a number of browsers (google chrome) and devices (Macbook Pro 14 inch, iPhone 13 pro).

We also went through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that they were responsive on all different screen sizes.

All the links in the page will open in a new tab implementing 'target="_blank"' and have been manually tested to confirm that they will direct to the correct destination.
