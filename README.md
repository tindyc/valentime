# VALENTIME

![Valentime Logo](assets/images/valentime-logo.png)

Created for the Code Institute's February 2022 Hackathon, Love is in the air.

Valentime: Spend more time creating memories!

During lockdown, we had to rethink what a date night was. The local pub was closed, we were unable to eat at our favourite restaurants, and there were no new films showing at the cinemas.

It would have been great to have a site where a suitable at home date night idea could be randomly selected for you ... so we decided to make that idea a reality!

By using the Valentime site to randomly generating a date night idea based on the category you select, you will have more time to spend on the important stuff - making memories with your loved one ❤️.

And as love comes in all different forms, from self love, the love of a friend group to romantic love - we have created seperate sections for each of these - so leave the pain of choosing what to do in the past, and start using Valentime today!

## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the theme of the site is all about love, we chose to use the classic romantic colours of reds and pinks. We have chosen some complementary colours that stand out from the pink to be used throughout the site.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* We are using [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script?query=dancing+script) for the headers on the site.
